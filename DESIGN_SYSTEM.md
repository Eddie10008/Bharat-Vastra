# Bharat Vastra Design System

## Overview

The Bharat Vastra platform incorporates a unique design system inspired by the Ganesha logo, featuring geometric patterns, mandala-inspired elements, and traditional Indian design principles while maintaining a modern, clean aesthetic.

## Logo Design

### Ganesha Logo
The central logo features Lord Ganesha seated on a stylized map of India, surrounded by geometric and astrological elements:

- **Central Figure**: Ganesha in meditative pose with traditional attributes
- **Geometric Framework**: Concentric circles, connecting lines, and nodes
- **Astrological Elements**: Compass-like symbols and celestial references
- **India Map**: Silhouette of the Indian subcontinent as the base
- **Color Scheme**: Monochromatic black and white for versatility

### Logo Usage
- **Header**: Primary logo with text
- **Favicon**: Simplified version for browser tabs
- **Loading States**: Animated version with geometric elements
- **Decorative Elements**: Pattern variations throughout the platform

## Design Components

### 1. Decorative Patterns
Four pattern variants inspired by the logo:

- **Default**: Concentric circles with connecting lines and nodes
- **Border**: Rectangular frame with corner decorations
- **Mandala**: Radial pattern with 8-point symmetry
- **Minimal**: Simplified geometric elements

### 2. Color Palette
- **Primary**: Red (#dc2626) - Represents energy and prosperity
- **Secondary**: Purple (#c026d3) - Spiritual and royal connotations
- **Accent**: Gold (#d97706) - Traditional Indian gold
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### 3. Typography
- **Serif**: Playfair Display for headings and brand elements
- **Sans-serif**: Inter for body text and UI elements
- **Display**: Poppins for special text elements
