# Bharat Vastra Design System

## Overview

The Bharat Vastra platform incorporates a unique design system inspired by the Ganesha logo, featuring a monochromatic design with geometric patterns, mandala-inspired elements, and traditional Indian design principles while maintaining a modern, clean aesthetic. The design system celebrates spiritual heritage through the timeless elegance of black and white design.

## Logo Design

### Ganesha Logo
The central logo features Lord Ganesha seated on a stylized map of India, surrounded by geometric and astrological elements:

- **Central Figure**: Ganesha in meditative pose with traditional attributes (axe, noose, blessing gesture, modak)
- **Geometric Framework**: Concentric circles, connecting lines, and nodes of varying sizes
- **Astrological Elements**: Compass-like symbols with directional arrows and celestial references
- **India Map**: Detailed silhouette of the Indian subcontinent with state boundaries
- **Color Scheme**: Monochromatic black and white for timeless elegance
- **Traditional Attributes**: Four arms with specific mudras and sacred objects

### Logo Usage
- **Header**: Primary logo with text
- **Favicon**: Simplified version for browser tabs
- **Loading States**: Animated version with geometric elements
- **Decorative Elements**: Pattern variations throughout the platform

## Design Components

### 1. Decorative Patterns
Four pattern variants inspired by the logo:

- **Default**: Concentric circles with connecting lines and nodes
- **Border**: Rectangular frame with corner decorations
- **Mandala**: Radial pattern with 8-point symmetry
- **Minimal**: Simplified geometric elements

### 2. Monochromatic Color Palette
- **Black** (#000000) - Protection, mystery, elegance, strength, grounding
- **White** (#ffffff) - Purity, innocence, peace, new beginnings, divine light
- **Gray Scale** - Balance, neutrality, sophistication, timelessness
- **Monochromatic Design** - Focus on form, texture, and spiritual symbolism

### 3. Typography
- **Serif**: Playfair Display for headings and brand elements
- **Sans-serif**: Inter for body text and UI elements
- **Display**: Poppins for special text elements
